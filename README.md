# Drools Demo

This is a minimal example project using the [Drools](https://www.drools.org/) rules engine. The project builds a simple Java application that loads a single DRL rule and executes it.

## Requirements

- Java 21 (or later)
- Gradle

## Running

Use Gradle to build and run the demo:

```bash
gradle run
```

The application inserts the string `"World"` into the session, and the rule prints a greeting.
